# Rust-Ai-Agent - Deepseek
My 1st project using Rust , Just check , maybe useful  😁
im noob, start from scratch , learning programming just copy and paste generate code from Ai 😆 😆 , im not dev , this is just test 

to start 

Get your Api key from deepseek 
https://platform.deepseek.com/

just only $2 for activated this API

and create .env in you root dir

# DeepSeek Configuration 
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=

DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com

DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat

DEEPSEEK_MAX_TOKENS=2048

DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE=0.7

and then 

cargo Run 

happy to chat with ur own deepseek

## 🤝 Contribution
fell free  

## 💡 Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZoeyX-FD/Rust-Ai-Agent---Deepseek.git

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the AI agent
cargo run

## 🎭 Loading Characters ( Im Inspired by ElizaOS ) The best role Model

### Character Selection Methods

#### 1. Interactive Character Selection
When you run the AI agent, you'll see a prompt to choose a character:
Available Characters:

Type 'coding_ninja' for Zara "CodeWizard" Chen
Type 'academic_researcher' for Dr. Rissa
Type 'masterchef_scientist' for Joey
Type 'startup_founder' for Alex Chen


#### 2. Direct Filename Loading
You can load any character by typing its filename:
```bash
# Load a character directly by filename
masterchef_scientist.json

3. Programmatic Character Loading
In your Rust code, you can load characters programmatically:

// Create a new character dynamically

let custom_character = PersonalityProfile {
    name: "Custom Character".to_string(),

// Add more custom configuration
};

{
    "name": "Your Character Name",
    "bio": { ... },
    "traits": { ... },
    "emotions": {
        "expressions": {
            "emotion_name": {
                "emojis": ["😄", "🚀"],
                "emotes": ["*does something*"]
            }
        }
    }
}

Best Practices
Keep character files in characters/ directory
Use meaningful, descriptive filenames
Maintain consistent JSON structure
Experiment with different personality traits
