feat: Enhanced AI Personality System and Database Integration

- Added dynamic emoji/emote support for characters
- Implemented SQLite-based conversation memory
- Created modular personality and knowledge management system
- Updated documentation with technical details and roadmap

Improvements:
- Character emotional expressions
- Persistent conversation context
- Flexible knowledge storage# Project Updates and Enhancements

## Personality System Overhaul

### Modular Personality Architecture ( No doubt ,im inspired by ElizaOS)
- Introduced comprehensive personality configuration system
- Created JSON-based character definition format
- Added support for dynamic personality loading

### Key Structural Changes
- Enhanced `personality.rs` with new structs:
  - `Biography`
  - `PersonalityTraits`
  - `EmotionalState`
  - `EmotionalExpression`
  - `CommunicationStyle`
  - `ContextRules`

### Character Loading Improvements
- Simplified personality loading mechanism
- Removed complex JSON loading commands
- Added support for direct filename-based character selection

### Emoji and Emote System
- Implemented context-specific emotional expressions
- Added methods to dynamically select emojis and emotes
- Created expressive response generation

### New Characters Added
1. Zara "CodeWizard" Chen (Coding Ninja)
   - Technical personality
   - Humor-driven communication
   - Programming-focused emotional expressions

2. Dr. Rissa (Academic Researcher)
   - Neuroscience and AI background
   - Scholarly emotional style
   - Intellectual communication approach

3. Joey (MasterChef Scientist)
   - Culinary science expert
   - Scientific cooking persona
   - Experimental emotional range

4. Alex Chen (Startup Founder)
   - Entrepreneurial spirit
   - Technology innovation focus
   - High-energy emotional expressions

### Technical Enhancements
- Improved error handling in personality loading
- Added flexible emoji and emote selection
- Created more dynamic character interaction model

### Core Design Principles
- Transform AI from stateless to stateful interactions
- Create persistent, intelligent conversation system
- Enable advanced context retention and learning

### Key Design Capabilities
1. **Conversation Logging**
   - Capture full interaction histories
   - Analyze communication patterns
   - Enable intelligent context retrieval

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Dynamic information storage
   - Incremental learning mechanism
   - Contextual response generation

3. **Personality Persistence**
   - Store character traits and emotional states
   - Track interaction statistics
   - Evolve AI personalities over time

### Long-Term Conversation Context Strategy
- Implement sliding window context management
- Use confidence-based information retention
- Develop semantic similarity matching
- Prune less relevant historical data

### Intelligent Context Preservation
- Detect conversation themes
- Maintain topic continuity
- Recognize user preferences
- Adapt communication style dynamically

## Future Roadmap
- Expand character diversity
- Enhance emotional intelligence
- Implement more sophisticated context adaptation

## Commit Highlights
- Refactored personality management
- Added rich, expressive character definitions
- Simplified character loading process
